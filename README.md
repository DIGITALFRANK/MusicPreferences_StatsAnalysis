# Music Preferences: Statistical Analysis
Statistacl Hypothesis Testing on the Young Peoples Survey from 2013 and the Pitchfork Music Dataset from 2017









## Analysing students that are an Only Child, and their preferences.
The Young Peoples Survey aggragated 1-5 scores from students in the UK on various topics, including life, music, and movie preferences.

Here we want to test 2 hypothesees, we want to make the following suggestions:

> Students that are an only child are less happy in life.

> Students that are an only child are into Metal and Hard Rock music and like Horror movies



For the first suggestion, we will formulate and test our hypothesis as follows:


__________

_Ha =>  'students that are an only child are **less happy in life**_

_H0 =>  students that are an only child are **as happy in life** as students that have children_

__________

We will use a Two-Sample Two-Tailed T-test to test the significance and accuracy of the equality or the difference in the mean of the scores the two groups rated their "Happiness In Life"


First let's compare summary statistics on how students who are an only child rated their happiness in life vs. students who have siblings

**summary statistics comparison here**

To the naked eye, the statistics seem pretty similar, with means of 3.67 and 3.71 respectively, and we can observe a small difference in standard diviations of 0.91 and 0.71 respectively.



Let's visualize both samples' survey results on "Happiness In Life"

**visualizations comparison here**





For the second suggestion, we will formulate and test our hypothesis as:

__________

_Ha =>  'Only Children' prefer Metal & Hard Rock and enjoy horror movies_

_H0 =>  Being an only child has no predictive factor on music genre preference or movie genre preference_

__________






## Music Genres vs. Movie Genres.

At this point, we want to test the suggestion that students with similar taste in music also have similar taste in movies.
Our Hypothesis statement is as follows:

__________

_Ha =>  students who scored the same on the same music genres, also scored the same on the same movie genres_

_H0 =>  a student's score on a certain music genre does not reflect his/her score on a certain movie genre_

__________
