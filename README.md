# Music Preferences: Statistical Analysis
Statistacl Hypothesis Testing on the Young Peoples Survey from 2013 and the Pitchfork Music Dataset from 2017









## Analysing the preferences of students that are an Only Child

Here we want to test 2 hypothesees, we want to make the following suggestions:

> Students that are an only child are not happy in life.

> Students that are an only child are into Metal and Hard Rock music and like Horror movies



Based on these suggestions, we will formulate our hypothesees as follow:

_Ha =>_  'Only Children' are **NOT** happy in life 
_H0 =>_  'Only Children' are as happy in life as the general population

_Ha =>_  'Only Children' always prefer Metal & Hard Rock and enjoy horror movies
_H0 =>_  Being an only child has no predictive factor on music genre preference or movie genre preference
