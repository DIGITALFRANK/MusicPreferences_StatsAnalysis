# Music Preferences: Statistical Analysis
Statistacl Hypothesis Testing on the Young Peoples Survey from 2013 and the Pitchfork Music Dataset from 2017









## Analysing the preferences of students that are an Only Child

Here we want to test 2 hypothesees, we want to make the following suggestions:

> Students that are an only child are not happy in life.

> Students that are an only child are into Metal and Hard Rock music and like Horror movies



For the first suggestion, we will formulate and test our hypothesis as follows:


__________

_Ha =>  'Only Children' are **NOT** happy in life_

_H0 =>  'Only Children' are as happy in life as the general population_

__________



Let's first compare summary statistics on how students who are an only child rated their happiness in life vs. students who have siblings
** summary statistics comparison here **


Let's visualize both samples' survey results on "Happiness In Life"
** visualizations comparison here **





For the second suggestion, we will formulate and test our hypothesis as:

__________

_Ha =>  'Only Children' prefer Metal & Hard Rock and enjoy horror movies_

_H0 =>  Being an only child has no predictive factor on music genre preference or movie genre preference_

__________






## Music Genres vs. Movie Genres

At this point, we want to test the suggestion that students with similar taste in music also have similar taste in movies.
Our Hypothesis statement is as follows:

__________

_Ha =>  students who scored the same on the same music genres, also scored the same on the same movie genres_

_H0 =>  a student's score on a certain music genre does not reflect his/her score on a certain movie genre_

__________
